To [monitor Bun performance](/guide/performance-monitoring.html), you can use OpenTelemetry
instrumentation that comes with Bun and Uptrace.

Uptrace is an [open source APM](https://uptrace.dev/get/open-source-apm.html) for OpenTelemetry that
helps developers pinpoint failures and find performance bottlenecks. Uptrace can process billions of
spans on a single server and allows to monitor your software at 10x lower cost.

You can [get started](https://uptrace.dev/get/get-started.html) with Uptrace by downloading a
DEB/RPM package or a pre-compiled Go binary.
