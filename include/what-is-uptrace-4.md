To [monitor Bun performance](/guide/performance-monitoring.html), you can use OpenTelemetry
instrumentation that comes with Bun and Uptrace.

Uptrace is an [OpenTelemetry backend](https://uptrace.dev/blog/opentelemetry-backend.html) with an
intuitive query builder, rich dashboards, alerting rules, and integrations for most languages and
frameworks. It can process billions of spans and metrics on a single server and allows to monitor
your applications at 10x lower cost.

Uptrace uses ClickHouse database to store traces, metrics, and logs. You can use it to monitor
applications and set up automatic alerts to receive notifications via email, Slack, Telegram, and
more.

You can [get started](https://uptrace.dev/get/get-started.html) with Uptrace by downloading a
DEB/RPM package or a pre-compiled Go binary.
