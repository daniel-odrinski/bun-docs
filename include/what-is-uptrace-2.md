To [monitor Bun performance](/guide/performance-monitoring.html), you can use OpenTelemetry
instrumentation that comes with Bun and Uptrace.

Uptrace is a [source-available APM](https://uptrace.dev/get/open-source-apm.html) powered by
OpenTelemetry and ClickHouse. It allows you to identify and fix bugs in production faster knowing
what conditions lead to which errors.

You can [get started](https://uptrace.dev/get/get-started.html) with Uptrace by downloading a
DEB/RPM package or a pre-compiled Go binary.
