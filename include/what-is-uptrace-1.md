instrumentation that comes with Bun and Uptrace.

Uptrace is an [open source APM](https://uptrace.dev/get/open-source-apm.html) for OpenTelemetry with
an intuitive query builder, rich dashboards, automatic alerts, and integrations for most languages
and frameworks.

DEB/RPM package or a pre-compiled Go binary.
